      #Contingency

      * Use a text editor: [atom.io](https://atom.io)
      * Starter projects are included in the learner download files.
      * Use Atom to open and edit **index.html** and **style.css** files.
      * Save your changes, then open **index.html** in your browser to view the website.

      #Specific Examples + Instructions

      ##Do the Robot (slide 8)
      Follow the Do the Robot [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/do-the-robot/), including the extensions. Recommended tasks: High-five, Jumping Jack

      ##What is HTML? (slide 15)
      Yes, HTML is a coding language. We are giving instructions to the browser to tell it how to display the website.
      <br>No, HTML is not a programming language. We aren't using programming concepts like loops, variables, functions, etc. (yet!)

      ##Why Learn HTML? (slide 16)
      House analogy = the html is like the structure/walls/furniture, the css is the design/paint/accessories, and the javascript is the functionality (like the alarm/security system). Also use the body analogy (bones, clothes, personality) if that works better for the crowd.

      ##Source Whisperer (slide 21-24)
      See the Source Whisperer [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/source-whisperer/) for reference.

      ##Superhero Profiles (slide 25-32)
      Use the Superhero Profiles [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/superhero-profiles/") (and included solution sheet) to facilitate this activity.

      ##Create an Account (slide 29)
      It might take a few minutes for learners to verify their accounts. They have the option of not creating an account, but will not be able to save their projects.

      ##Setting up Glitch (slide 30)
      Glitch is a free online tool (and community!) that we can use to create and share websites.
      <br><br>These setup steps are optional, but highly recommended as they will make learners' lives a lot easier as they build their websites!

      ##What's the Difference (slide 36)
      This is the exact same website! One with css and the other with the stylesheet removed.

      ##What Does CSS Look Like? (slide 37)
      Draw attention to the types of brackets used. Point out the colons and semi-colons. Ask: What do you think this code will do? (A: All paragraph text will turn red)

      ##Rules (slide 39)
      Encourage learners to type into the text area to see their css code applied to the paragraph below. Try `background-color` or use other styles found on css.cool - see the next slide.

      ##Innovation Website (slide 41-49)
      Use the Innovation Website [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/innovation-website/) (and included solution sheet) to facilitate this activity.

      ##Creating Your Website (slide 48)
      Walk learners through these steps using the [solution sheet](http://bit.ly/innovation-website-glitch).
      <br>Some learners will choose to use their digital copy of the solution sheet to work ahead, which is totally fine.

      ##Assessment Considerations (slide 52)
      Have learners use these points for discussion in their table groups. Use the example of a lesson plan from today, or another lesson they have in mind. Loop back after 5 minutes to share with the class.

      ##Lesson Planning (slide 55)
      Give learners 45 minutes to lesson plan either on their own or in pairs. You may want to move learners based off of grade levels or subject areas so that they can collaborate with educators of a similar focus.

      ##Show and Tell (slide 56)
      Save time for volunteers to share what they are working on (doesn't need to be finished!)

      ##Stretch Goal: Debugging (slides 57-58)
      If you have time! Discuss what a "bug" is in coding (an issue or problem in our code). Demonstrate these strategies in an example project if possible.
      <br><br>Pair Programming = when learners pair up and take turns rotating between the two roles of "driver" and "navigator" - where the driver uses the mouse and keyboard, and the navigator gives verbal instructions. We can catch bugs more quickly with two people working on the same project!

      ##Stretch Goal: Erase All Kittens (slide 59)
      If you have time! This game is a fun activity for students to play if they complete an assignment early in class (e.g.). Educators will need to create an account to access the free demo.

      ##Next Steps (slide 61)
      Encourage learners to write their next step on a post-it note and stick it on a wall before leaving.
